# Multi-label-classification-of-handwritten-digits-and-english-alphabet
Wec trained an image classifier that can successfully predict the characters in the input. 
Each image consists of two characters: one letters and one number, which may appear anywhere in the image. 
These characters have different orientation, size, and style. The image can also be affected by a variety of noises. 
We predicted the letter out of 26 alphabet (A-Z) and the digit out of 10 digits (0-9) in the given image. 
The images may contain either upper or lower case letters.
